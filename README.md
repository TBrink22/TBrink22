# TBrink22 

**'Computer Science (Programming, Linux, Security)'**

I am an enrolled Tennessee Tech Student on my third of study, having transfered from Columbia State Community College. Most of my commits are private school related projects but I will be adding public projects soon. I have a passion for computers that I hope to leverage in a profressional setting, producing meaningful work.
